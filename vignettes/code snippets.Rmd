## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
fit_ebp_tf_bc <- ebp_tf(
  fixed = eqIncome ~ eqsize + cash + self_empl + 
    unempl_ben + age_ben + surv_ben + sick_ben + dis_ben + 
    rent + fam_allow + house_allow + cap_inv + tax_adj,
  pop_data = eusilcA_pop,
  pop_domains = "state",
  pop_subdomains = "district",
  smp_data = eusilcA_smp,
  smp_domains = "state",
  smp_subdomains = "district",
  transformation = "box.cox",
  MSE = F,
  custom_indicator = list(
    income_range = function(y) { max(y) - min(y) }
  ),
  na.rm = TRUE
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
